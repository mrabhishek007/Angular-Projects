Add firebase to Angular project :

  1. npm install firebase angularfire2 --save

  2. Follow "https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/blob/master/docs/install-and-setup.md" to setup Angular App with Firebase

  3. Retrieving list from Realtime Database : (with key and without keys )
      * If u want to perform some operation on the list of data then use "db.list('/Course').snapshotChanges()" bcz it also gives
        array of object which contains 'key' its value etc & key is required to perform any operation on a object ( ex : updating a course for courselist)
      * If u just want to show list of data then simply use "db.list('/Course').valueChanges()" it just gives array of values( without keys )


  4. Uses of ngDestroy() to unsubscribe form Observable bcz firebase is realtime db it always checks for updates, so prevent memory
      leaks while routing we need to unsubscribe the current observables to prevent memory leak

                          OR

          USE ASYNC PIPES WHICH WLL AUTOMATICALLY DO THE ABOVE TRICK (Even No need to subscribe manually))

  5. async pipe - Automatically unsubscribe from observable when the component is destroyed (recommended)
      EX : <div class="list-group-item" *ngFor="let course of $courseList | aync" >{{course}}</div> //automatically unsubscribe when component is destroyed
