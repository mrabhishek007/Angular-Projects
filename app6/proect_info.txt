1. Routing And Navigation

2. Use routerLink directive instead of href(href will load the whole page) EX : ,<a routerLink = "/profile" >

3. Use [rounterLink] property binding syntax when dealing with route parameters which accepts array as parameters ink]="[]"
     EX :  <a [routerLink] = "['followers', follower.id]" >

4. 'routerLinkActive : css classes list (separated by space)' used to add external css to an element to tell the element is active
ex: <a  routerLinkActive: "active" makes a nav bar active when  nav tab specific route is clicked  >
i.e. it dynamically apply css class to an element when it is active

5. Router : It is a service by angular
   In order to navigate user programmatically and add query parm & add query string dynamically we need 'Router' service

6. ActivatedRoute: Service provide by angular
     In order to get access to route parameters we have to inject or use 'ActiveRoute' Class provided by Angular
     Routing with snapshot(used when we work on same page routing. ex: transition page with back and next button )  and observables(used when data is reloaded again on the samepage ex: open different user profile on the same page )
